# Lightweight Process Scheduler
A process scheduler that makes use of a round-robin approach to schedule its processes.

# Getting Started
1. Run 'make' to generate all test and library files.
2. A set of test programs will be generated which you can run to observe the scheduler in action. These include: 'hungry', 'nums', 'snakes', and 'test'.

# Notes
Exiting from some of the test programs requires pressing Ctrl + C several times to terminate each process being run by the scheduler. Once all processes are terminated, the scheduler will end the test.
